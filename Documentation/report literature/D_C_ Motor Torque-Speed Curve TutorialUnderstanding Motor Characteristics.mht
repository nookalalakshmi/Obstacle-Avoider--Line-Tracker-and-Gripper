<FONT color=3Dfirebrick>Torque</FONT> (also called a <FONT=20

forces that=20
act in a rotational manner. You apply a torque or moment when you turn a =

shown in=20
the picture of a ratchet, a torque is created by a vertical force =
applied at the=20
end of the handle. The <FONT color=3Dfirebrick>force, F</FONT>, applied =
to the=20
ratchet as shown causes a tendency to rotate about point O. The force =
can be=20
broken down into two components: a <FONT color=3Dfirebrick>radial =
component,=20

F<SUB>tan</SUB></FONT>, perpendicular to the handle that does contribute =
to the=20
torque. The distance from point O to the point of action of F is =
described by=20
the <FONT color=3Dfirebrick>direction vector, r</FONT>. The <FONT=20

arm by=20
applying the force closer to the head of the ratchet,the magnitude of =
the torque=20
would decrease, even if the force remained the same. Thus, if we change =

effective length of the handle, we change the torque (see equation 1). =
