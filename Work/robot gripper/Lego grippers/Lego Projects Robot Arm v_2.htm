width=150 align=left></A> <BR clear=all></P>
<P>After the surprising success of my <A 
href="http://www.cuug.ab.ca/lapierrs/creative/lego/arm1/index.html">previous 
robot arm</A> I decided to rebuild it from scratch, this time with an improved 
gripper and powered by an electric motor. I wanted to get incrementally closer 
to making a Lego version of Radio Shack's Armatron toy. </P>
<P>I kept the basic structure of the arm the same but increased its size. I used 
universal joints for all places where the power train needed to flex (ie, at the 
joints) because I found the method of using a free-wheeling crown gear 
introduced lateral stress on joints, caused undesirable secondary motion when a 
joint moved, and wasn't very strong - the crown gears would often slip under 
high torque. </P>
<P>This time around I bought a couple of gear packs from Lego shop-at-home to 
get some gear types I didn't have before and to increase my supply. I totally 
redesigned the wrist and gripper to take advantage of the large turntable gear, 
and I'm really proud of how that part turned out. I also designed a manual 
transmission in the base of the arm so that all the movements could be powered 
by a single motor, as in the Armatron. </P>
<P>This arm has five degrees of freedom: </P>
<OL>
  <LI>The gripping claw opens and closes, and is strong enough to pick up a 
  small Lego model. 
  <LI>The claw rotates 360°. 
  <LI>The wrist bends up and down and has a range of about 120°. 
  <LI>The elbow bends horizontally and has about 120° of freedom. Although I 
  constructed both the wrist and elbow joints to be able to flex through 180°, 
  in practice they are limited by the use of universal joints to pass power 
  through the joint. 
  <LI>The shoulder rotates the arm up and down and has a range of about 90 
  degrees. </LI></OL>
<P>The transmission has an engage-disengage control for each axis of motion, and 
bidirectional motion is accomplished by reversing the electric motor. This 
limits the ability to move multiple axes at once. Overcoming this would have 
required a transmission twice as complex, and since this was my first time 
building a transmission I wanted to keep it as simple as possible. </P>
<P>One more degree of freedom is needed to equal the Armatron - a rotating base. 
I could have mounted the whole arm on a rotating base and also powered that with 
the motor, but then the controls would move with the arm, which is icky. Having 
stationary controls would require passing five power axes (or one plus four 
control channels) through a swivel joint, and I have not yet figured out a way 
to do that with Lego. In the Armatron it is accomplished with nested 
double-sided ring gears, but Lego does not have such gears. Another way - much 
simpler - would be to use a seperate motor for each joint. This seems to be the 
way most Lego robot arms are built. But I only have one motor and I wanted the 
challenge of running everything with it. The sacrifice was losing the moving 
base. </P>
<P>This arm uses about 85 gears, and I really had to gear down to get sufficient 
torque to move everything and pick up objects. As a result, the arm's motion is 
deathly slow. This is another problem that could be overcome by using multiple 
motors. </P>
<P>The Lego motor I used has a shaft speed of 350RPM, or 5.833 rotations per 
second. This table shows the gear ratio and effective movement rate for each 
part of the arm: </P>

<P>There are still plenty of things that can be improved in this design, but for 
now I think I'm done with building robot arms in Lego. At least until I get some 
more motors. </P>
<P>Here are some more pictures of the arm with discussion. At the bottom I have 
provided LDraw/MLcad files showing the construction of the gripper and the power 
train. </P>

width=150 align=left></A> <BR clear=all></P>
<P>The above images show the gripper in its fully open and fully closed 
positions. At its widest it can fit about ten studs between the two halves. </P>
<P class=ctr><A

width=150 align=left></A> <BR clear=all></P>
<P>Here are closeups of the wrist joint from the left and right sides. The large 
grey gear on the left controls the wrist elevation and is driven from the axle 
on the underside of the blue section of the arm. The gears on the right side of 
the arm control the wrist rotation; they move a small gear inside the wrist 
turntable that causes the black half to rotate while the clear half remains 
stationary (not shown because it's mostly hidden by other bricks; see the MLcad 
file below if you want to see how it's built). In the second picture you can 
clearly see the black worm gear that opens and closes the grip. </P>
<P class=ctr><A

width=150 align=left></A> <BR clear=all></P>
<P>The above pictures show detail of the left and right sides of the elbow 
joint. Most of the gears inside the frame of the upper arm (yellow) are for 
converting the horizontal plane of axles to a vertical plane so that they can 
pass through the elbow joint. The additional gears on the right (stud) side 
nearer the joint are for actually moving the elbow joint. The blue gear on top 
is joined by studs to the forearm (blue) and moves it directly. </P>

<P>Here are three views of the base of the arm and the transmission and control 
panel. The first image shows the inside of the shoulder joint as seen from 
below. Each of the four axles that run to the shoulder is converted from 
vertical to horizontal by two small crown gears inside the black and red housing 
you see inside the yellow box, and then feeds through a universal joint aligned 
with the shoulder's axis of rotation and into the yellow upper arm. </P>
<P>The second image shows details of the main section of the transmission. The 
electric motor on the right powers two axles that run horizontally through the 
transmission from right to left. Each of these two axles can be coupled to 
either of two of the four vertical axles leading upwards by pushing one of the 
controls on the near face of the arm base. One control is shown so engaged here. 
Power feeds from the horizontal powered axle through two gears attached to the 
grey bar to the horizontal black worm gear. Pushing the control inward tilts the 
grey bar more towards the vertical, causing the worm gear to engage with the 
gear attached to the vertical shaft. This mechanism takes up a lot of space 
which is why the transmission is split into upper and lower halves, each 
controlling two axles. </P>
<P>The third image shows the left side of the base, with the fifth control for 
the shoulder joint. This one is simpler. The lower transmission axle drives one 
of two side-by-side double-beveled gears. Pushing the control rod in brings two 
offset small double-beveled gears into contact with the two larger ones, 
transmitting the power into the small gearbox that drives the chains that move 
the large yellow gear, which directly moves the shoulder. This gear box includes 
worm gears, which effectively act as brakes to prevent the shoulder from moving 
under the weight of the arm and its load. You can see a black chain disappearing 
up into the red part of the base and then another one appearing nearby to drive 
the yellow gear; there is more reduction going on between the two chains inside 
the red housing. </P>
<P>This is my first attempt at designing any kind of transmission. It works 
well, but I'm sure I could do much better in terms of simplicity, compactness 
and capability. </P>

<P>The lowest the arm can reach is about 9 studs below the base, and the highest 
it can reach is about 84 studs above the base. </P>

<P>Reaching for a small ship... Grabinated! </P>
<P>The blue one-minifig craft above is about the limit of the arm's lifting 
ability because anything heavier will destroy the claw mechanism. I could have 
strengthened the construction to compensate but that would have reduced the 
clearance around the claw halves and would have made it heavier. </P>
<H3>MLcad files</H3>
<P>Note that neither of these model files contains step-by-step instructions. 
They're meant to be looked at in MLcad and pulled apart. Make sure you have all 
the latest parts packs installed in LDraw! </P>
<P><A href="http://www.cuug.ab.ca/lapierrs/creative/lego/arm2/grip.ldr"><IMG 
height=358 src="Lego Projects Robot Arm v_2_files/grip.jpg" width=256 
align=left></A> Here's an LDraw/MLcad file containing the complete structure of 
the wrist joint and gripper. There are two problems with the gripper as shown. 
One is that it's weak - forcing it open will pop off a brick that anchors the 
central worm gear in place. The second is that there is room for the worm gear 
to slide along its axle, which means that there is significant play in the 
mechanism. Even so, I'm very happy with this part of the model. I decided not to 
try to fix these problems because it would have made the gripper bulkier and 
heavier. <BR clear=all></P>

height=352 src="Lego Projects Robot Arm v_2_files/powertrain.jpg" width=384 
align=right></A> Here's another model definition for LDraw or MLcad (I recommend 
MLcad for this one because it contains some non-Lego primitives). This one shows 
the complete power train of the arm - all the moving parts. The rest of the 
construction is left out for clarity and is left as an exercise for the reader. 
There are a few things to note about this model: </P>
<OL>
  <LI>Axle lengths are not exactly as they are in the real arm. 
  <LI>LDraw lacks models for four types of gears I used in the arm. Specifically 
  the 9-tooth (red), 15-tooth (blue) and 21-tooth (yellow) large-toothed gears 
  from sets like <A href="http://guide.lugnet.com/set/803_2">803</A>, and a 
  36-tooth double-beveled gear from <A 
  href="http://guide.lugnet.com/set/10076">10076</A>. I've used the nearest 
  equivalents I could find in the LDraw part set. The colored gears are easily 
  spotted. The 36-tooth gear is represented in this file by the first 40-tooth 
  gear along the path from the motor to the yellow shoulder gear (the large grey 
  gear near the bottom left of the image at right). 
  <LI>LDraw also lacks models for the type of chain/tread that fits on the 
  large-toothed gears. This is the kind of chain used as caterpillar treads in 
  sets like <A href="http://guide.lugnet.com/set/780">780</A>. I've used red 
  belts generated by MLcad to show where these chains are used in the arm model. 

  <LI>I left out the transmission controls. They are represented here by the 
  five blue axles. Pushing on them engages axles, as shown, and pulling on them 
  disengages. </LI></OL>
