<P>Recently many kind of robot contests have being opened and some interesting 
reports of the challenge are found on the web. The Line Following is a kind of 
the robot contests to vie running speed on the line. I build a tiny line 
following robot which can run on the desk, moving the key board aside will do. 
It is for only a personal toy reduced its size less than one fifth compared to 
typical line following robots, not in formura. But I believe that it is suitable 
for home use in the small Japanese houses said that rabbit burrow...(^_^;. Of 
course I have also no time to take part in the robot contests :-(</P></DIV>
<DIV class=para>
<H3>About Line Follower</H3>
<P>The line follower is one of the self operating robot that follows a line that 
drawn on the floor. The basic operations of the line following are as 
follows:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Capture line position with optical sensors mounted at front end of the 
  robot. Most are using several number of photo-reflectors, and some leading 
  contestants are using an image sensor for image processing. The line sensing 
  procss requires high resolution and high robustness. 
  <LI>Steear robot to track the line with any steearing mechanism. This is just 
  a servo operation, any phase compensation will be required to stabilize 
  tracking motion by applying digital PID filter or any other servo argolithm. 
  <LI>Control speed according to the lane condition. Running speed is limited 
  during passing a curve due to friction of the tire and the floor. </LI></OL>
<P>There are two line styles, white line on the black floor and black line on 
the white floor. Most contest are adopting the first one in line width of 
between 15 and 25 millimeters.</P></DIV>

<P>Right image shows bottom view and side view of the built line following 
robot. All mechanical and electrical parts are mounted on a proto board, and it 
also constitutes the chasis.</P>
<P>The line following robot is upheld in three points of two driving wheels and 
a free wheel. The driving wheels are made with a 7 mm dia ball bearing and a 
rubber tire. The free wheel is a 5 mm dia ball bearing attached loosely. To 
drive driving wheels, two tiny <A 
href="http://elm-chan.org/works/ltc/mot.jpeg">vibration motors</A> that used for 
cellular phone, pager or any mobile equipment are used. Its shaft is pressed 
onto the tire with a spring plate, the output torque is transferred to the 
wheels.</P>
<P>The steearing mechanism is realized in <EM>differential drive</EM> that 
steear the robot by difference in rotation speed between the left wheel and the 
right wheel. It does not require any additional actuator, only controling the 
wheel speed will do.</P></DIV>

<P>An Atmel ATmega8 is used for the controller and it is powered by a lithium 
coin cell. The other lithium coin cell is for only motors. Separating the power 
supply into two cells is to avoid accidental reset of the microcontroller due to 
voltage dip by motor start current. Six photo-reflectors are mounted at front 
end of the chasis. They sense reflection rate of the floor under them. Motors 
are driven in PWM to control rotation speed lineary.</P></DIV>

<H3>Software</H3>
<H4>Using photo-reflectors</H4><IMG class=rset height=410 alt="" 
src="ELM - Desktop Line Following Robot_files/opt.png" width=440> 
<P>To detect a line to be followed, most contestants are using two or more 
number of poto-reflectors. Its output current that proportional to reflection 
rate of the floor is converted to voltage with a resister and tested it if the 
line is detected or not. However the threshold voltage cannot be fixed to any 
level because optical current by ambent light is added to the output current 
like the image shown right.</P>
<P>Most photo-detecting modules for industrial use are using modurated light to 
avoid interference by the ambient light. The detected signal is filtered with a 
band pass filter and disused signals are filtered out. Therefore only the 
modurated signal from the light emitter can be detected. Of course the detector 
must not be saturated by ambient light, this is effective when the detector is 
working in linear region.</P>
<P>In this project, pulsed light is used to cancel ambient light. This is 
suitable for arraied sensors that scanned in sequence to avoid interference from 
next sensor. The microcontroller starts to scan the sensor status, sample an 
output voltage, turn on LED and sample again the output voltage. The difference 
between the two samples is the optical current by LED, output voltage by the 
ambient light is canceled. The other sensors are also scanned the same avobe in 
sequence.</P></DIV>

<H4>Signal processing of line detection</H4><IMG class=rset height=270 alt="" 
src="ELM - Desktop Line Following Robot_files/grph2.png" width=600> 
<P>Right image shows the actual line posisiton vs detected line position in 
center value of 640. The microcontroller scans six sensors and calcurates the 
line position by output ratio of two sensors near the line. Thus the line 
position can be detected lineary with only six sensors. All the sensor outputs 
are captured as analog value that proportioning to reflection ratio, and the 
sensitivity have variety between each one of them. In this system, to remove the 
variations from the outputs, calibration parameters for each sensor can be held 
into non-volatile memory. This can be done with online mode. The microcontroler 
enters the online mode when an <A 
href="http://elm-chan.org/works/avrx/report_e.html#AVRSS">ISP cable</A> is 
attached, and it can be controlled with a terminal program in serial format of 
N81 38.4kbps. S1 command monitors sensor values, and S2 command calibrates 
variation of sensor gain on the reference surface (white paper). The ATmega8 
must be set to 8MHz internal osc.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=para>
<H4>Tracking control</H4><IMG class=rset height=380 alt="" 
src="ELM - Desktop Line Following Robot_files/steer1.png" width=500> 
<P>The line position is compeared to the center value to be tracked, the 
position error is processed with Proportional/Integral/Diffence filters to 
generate steering command. The line folloing robot tracks the line in PID 
control that the most popular argolithm for servo control.</P>
<P>The proportional term is the commom process in the servo system. It is only a 
gain amplifire without time dependent process. The differencial term is applied 
in order to improve the responce to disturbance, and it also compensate phase 
lag at the controled object. The D term will be required in most case to 
stabilize tracking motion. The I term is not used in this project from following 
resons. The I term that boosts DC gain is applied in order to remove left offset 
error, however, it often decrease servo stability due to its phase lag. The line 
following operation can ignore such tracking offset so that the I term is not 
required.</P>
<P>When any line sensing error has occured for a time due to getting out of line 
or end of line, the motors are stopped and the microcontroller enters sleep 
state of zero power consumption.</P></DIV>
