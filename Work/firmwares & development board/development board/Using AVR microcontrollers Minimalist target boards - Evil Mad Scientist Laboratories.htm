  <TR>
    <TD>This is a quick how-to guide on making ultra-simple development boards 
      for programming AVR microcontrollers. Most recent-vintage AVRs can be 
      programmed through an ISP (in-system programmer) connection; all that is 
      really needed is a place for the chip to sit and a way to connect to the 
      programmer. That's where these minimalist AVR "target boards" come in. 
      These little boards cost only about $2 and take only a few minutes to 
      make. It turns out that I build a lot of these because asking "how do you 
      make a circuit to program the AVR?" is really the same as asking how you 
      can program an AVR that is in a circuit. And, we might as well start with 
      a simple circuit. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>
<TABLE width=500>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2>There are two basic types of microcontroller programmer that 
      you can imagine: one that has a socket for your chip, and one that hooks 
      up to your circuit where your chip is installed. We're interested in the 
      latter, the set of so-called in-system programmers, sometimes called 
      in-circuit programmers. You can also get programmers with dedicated 
      sockets, of course, but they are typically more expensive and are not 
      fundamentally "better." With an in-system programmer, not only can you 
      program microcontrollers that are in larger circuits, but you can also 
      easily <I>make</I> programmer target boards with sockets, giving you the 
      benefits of a programmer with a socket. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>

      width=240></A> </TD>
    <TD>The de facto standard USB in-system AVR programmer is the Atmel AVRISP 
      mkII, part number ATAVRISP2-ND from <A 
      href="http://www.digikey.com/">Digi-Key</A>, for $36. I actually wrote a 
      bit about using this programmer <A 
      href="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/avrmac">last year</A>. 
      It's a good very-few-frills programmer and it works quite well. It has a 
      hard plastic shell with a USB "B" connector on one end and a cable ending 
      in a 6-pin ISP connector on the other end. (If you take the case off of 
      the AVRISP mkII, the circuit board has a place for you to add a 10-pin ISP 
      cable as well, but this is an unpublicized feature.) </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2>One drawback to this programmer is that it requires external 
      power to be applied to the target board in order to operate. That's kind 
      of silly, because the programmer draws the power that it needs to operate 
      from USB, but does not pass that through to power the microcontroller 
      during programming. Ideally, the programmer should have a switch, so that 
      you can either use the programmer to power your target board or not. <BR>

      AVR Programmer</A> from Adafruit industries (Reviewed <A 
      href="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/usbtinyisp">here</A>) is 
      probably a better choice for most applications. It comes as an easy kit 
      for <DEL>$18.00</DEL> $22.00 and it includes both 6-pin and 10-pin 
      interfaces. The killer feature versus the AVRISP mkII is that it lets you 
      use the USB power to directly power your target board. Well, that and that 
      it comes with <I>both</I> 6-pin and 10-pin ISP cable connections. <BR>

  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2>
      <P>One other neat option (for some of you): You can <A 
      href="http://tinker.it/now/2006/12/04/turn-arduino-into-an-avr-isp-programmer/">use 
      Arduino as an AVR-ISP programmer</A>. 
      <P>For folks that don't want USB, there is no shortage of serial and 
      parallel ISP programmers. Most of them use the 10-pin interface. Adafruit 
      has <A 
      href="http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=16">one 
      of each</A> serial and parallel. You can also get them from other sources 
      (e.g., <A 
      href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/categories.php?cPath=1_7">SparkFun</A>), 
      but usually at a higher cost. And, if you do have a parallel port, let's 
      not forget that you can <I>almost</I> whip one up <A 
      href="http://www.instructables.com/id/E5H5UDWB5UEUKIKV8V/">out of thin 
      air</A>. 
      <P>Anyway, back to the target boards. Previously we've mainly used "real" 
      development boards that include power supplies, communications, and a 
      crystal oscillator. </P></TD></TR>

      excellent open-source reference designs by Pascal Stang.)

      <P>So, when does it make sense to solder your own target boards? For 
      starters, it's easier to use through-hole (DIP) packaged AVRs. One of the 
      really nice things about the AVR series of microcontrollers is that a many 
      of them are available in hobbyist-friendly through-hole (DIP) packages. 
      (However, if do need to use one of the varieties that is only available in 
      a surface-mount package, getting somebody else's development board or 
      laying out your own can really make sense.) 
      <P>Let's get started.
      <P>To begin with, we'll make a minimal target board for programming an 
      ATtiny2313, a popular 20-pin AVR microcontroller.

      <P>Here are the components: Prototyping perfboard (<A

      2x3 DIP header (Part of BG Micro part number ACS1019, $0.33), and a 20-pin 
      DIP socket (BG Micro part number soc1029, $0.55). We also have a couple of 
      optional components: a zero insertion force (ZIF) socket and a 3 x AAA 
      battery box. ZIF sockets tend to be quite expensive-- we found these on 
      eBay for only a few dollars each, so we'll actually build this board with 
      one.

      <P></P></TD>
    <TD>
      <P>The first step is to position the socket and the ISP connector header 
      on the protoboard, and then (important!) to mark one end of the ISP 
      connector as being the end that contains pin 1. When you eventually hook 
      up the ISP connector cable to the header, you will need to make sure that 
      you have the correct orientation. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2><BR>
      <P><BR>The next step is to determine how to hook up the pins of the ISP 
      header to the pins of the socket. Atmel <A 
      href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2521.pdf">Application 
      Note 42</A> describes the pinouts of the 6-pin and 10-pin ISP interface 
      connectors. From above, they look like this: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=118 alt="" 
      src="Using AVR microcontrollers Minimalist target boards - Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories_files/avrtargetboards_1.jpg" 
      width=275> </CENTER><BR>
      <P>The pins on the 6-pin interface are power (+Vcc) and ground, and the 
      four "signals" of the ISP connector, which are called RESET, SCK, MISO and 
      MOSI. You will notice that the 10-pin interface is just padded by a lot of 
      fat-- it doesn't provide additional functionality. 
      <P>(Note: The nature of the power (Vcc) line is context sensitive, and you 
      will need to think about which way your power goes through that connector. 
      If you are using the AVRISP mkII or most other programmers, the Vcc is 
      expected to be provided <I>from</I> the target board to the programmer. 
      This is used to indicate to the programmer that the target is "live" and 
      ready to be programmed. If this is the case, you <I>must</I> provide a 
      separate power source for the target board. If you use the USBtinyISP, you 
      have the <I>option</I> to use the Vcc pin on the ISP interface to provide 
      power <I>to</I> the target board. That option should be disabled if your 
      target board does supply power to the Vcc pin of the ISP interface.) 
      <P><BR>
      <P>Next, we need to identify the pins of the AVR that attach to those of 
      the ISP connector. You can begin by looking at the datasheet for your 
      particular flavor of AVR ( <A 
      href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/datasheets.asp?family_id=607">list 
      here</A>) and finding the six pins that match up to the names of the pins 
      on the ISP connector. Here, I've highlighted the relevant pins of three 
      AVR devices that I happen to like and come in 8-pin (ATtiny45), 20-pin 
      (ATtiny2313) and 28-pin (ATmega168) DIP packages: 
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG height=230 alt="" 
      src="Using AVR microcontrollers Minimalist target boards - Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories_files/avrtargetboards_2.jpg" 
      width=400> </CENTER>
      <P>Many <I>but not all</I>of the AVR devices in a given package (e.g., 
      DIP-8) share the same ISP connector pinouts, so these target boards can 
      sometimes (with caution) even be used for different AVR microcontrollers. 
      For example, the ATmega8, ATmega48, ATmega88, and ATmega168 share the same 
      28-pin pinouts. Note that in the figure above there are more than six 
      connections to the ATmega168. That's because there are extra power and 
      ground lines running to the analog circuitry of the chip, which should be 
      wired up even when the analog section is not in use. <BR>

      <P><BR></P></TD>
    <TD>Now that we know where the various ISP pins of the header and the chip 
      are, we can wire things up. We need six wires (obviously)-- hook MISO to 
      MISO, MOSI to MOSI, and so on, and solder up the lines. Remember to index 
      the header from the end that you marked earlier, the end with pin 1.

    <TD>You can build a simpler, smaller, and much cheaper version of this 
      target board by omitting the ZIF socket. It's more difficult to use if you 
      take the chip out *a lot* but otherwise it's a good solution. And of 
      course, if you are using a programmer that supplies power to the target 
      microcontroller, you can even omit the battery box. Cost under $2 and 
      assembly time under 5 minutes. Nice. <BR>
      <P><BR></P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2>So where do you go from here? First, get that programmer if 
      you haven't already got one. Then install the GNU toolchain that's 
      appropriate for your system (e.g., <A 
      href="http://winavr.sourceforge.net/">winavr</A> for Windows or <A 
      href="http://www.digithink.com/OSX-AVR/Introduction/Main">OSX-AVR</A> on 
      the Mac), and then download some sample code and go to town-- there's no 
      shortage of cool AVR projects out there, and we hope that that these hints 
      will give a push in the right direction. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

The killer feature versus the AVRISP mkII is that it lets you use the USB power 
to directly power your target board.<BR><BR>Hmm, how? I'd be happy to open my
